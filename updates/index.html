          <h2>New Look and Forms Page</h2>
          <h5>Oct 14, 2022</h5>
<p>We have now changed the site to have a new background color on all content sections, similar to the Updates Page.
  We have also added a new section for Forms, this makes it easier to report bugs and get discord notifications.</p>

          <h2>Navigation Bar and Header</h2>
          <h5>Oct 13, 2022</h5>
          <p>Today we finished the navigation bar on the website. This feature is at the top of every page of the website, and it allows you to get to one of the main pages anywhere.
            We also added headers to the title of each page, this makes the title look better and makes every page have the same look, instead of being different.</p>

          <h2>Bugs Cont.</h2>

<p>We have fixed the bugs concerning the color of the site in the Stories Page, 
  as of right now, when this post goes live it should be fixed on the Updates page as well.</p>

          <h2>Bugs</h2>
          <h5>October 13, 2022</h5>
<p>We are aware of the bugs concerning the color of the pages and navigation bar in the Stories and Updates page. 
  The website will still work perfectly fine, it is just the color of the site that is bugging. We are trying to fix them asap. By the end of today (10/13)
  we expect the navigation bar to be working perfectly. Thank You for you patience, LeMoose6.</p>
